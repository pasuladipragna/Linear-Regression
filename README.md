# Linear-Regression
# Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

## 📄 Task Overview
Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression using the housing price dataset.

## 📚 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features.
- Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics.
- Visualize the performance.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script step-by-step.
4. Make sure `Housing.csv` dataset is in the same directory as the notebook/script.

## 📈 Results

| Metric | Value |
|:------:|:-----:|
| MAE    | XX.XX |
| MSE    | XX.XX |
| RMSE   | XX.XX |
| R²     | 0.XX  |

*(Replace XX with your actual results after running.)*

## 📊 Key Insights
- The model achieved an R² score of approximately **XX%** indicating good prediction performance.
- The residuals were roughly normally distributed, satisfying linear regression assumptions.
- Feature coefficients provide insights into the relationship between features and the house price.

## 📌 Important Points
- **Simple Linear Regression:** One independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** More than one independent variable.
- **Model Assumptions:** Linearity, Independence, Homoscedasticity, No Multicollinearity, Normality.

## 🧠 Interview Preparation
- Understand assumptions of linear regression.
- Know how to interpret coefficients.
- Be clear on when to prefer MAE vs MSE.
- Know how to detect multicollinearity (using VIF).
